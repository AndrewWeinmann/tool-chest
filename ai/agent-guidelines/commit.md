# Commit Guidelines

The subject is an imperative summary of the patch in 60 characters or less. The body is a description of _why_ the changes were made, hard-wrapped to 72 characters. DO NOT include a list of the code changes made, that's what the `git log` is for. If the why isn't clear, ask for clarification, then incorporate it. Move links or anything required to be longer than 72 characters into footnotes at the end of the body using the format "[number]:".
