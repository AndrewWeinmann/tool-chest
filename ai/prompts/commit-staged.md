# Commit Staged

Create a git commit for the staged changes in this branch that tells a clear, coherent story of the changes. Before committing, verify what's staged by running `git diff --staged --name-only`. Base your commit message ONLY on those staged files - do not include changes from unstaged files or the working directory in your message. Follow the commit guidelines. DO NOT make code changes. DO NOT stage additional changes.
